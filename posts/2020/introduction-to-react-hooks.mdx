# About Figma

To understand why _Figma_ is the best design tool for our company, you have to understand what we do.
As a designer, I’ve been crafting digital experiences for the past ten years, having contributed to the growth of companies such as Hopper, Lightspeed, and Breather, among others.
Throughout this journey, I’ve had the opportunity to meet the most talented designers, engineers, growth marketers, and build a world-class team to develop startups worldwide. We call this team Narative.

> Narative is a studio based in 3 different cities around the world; so right off the bat we’re already facing a challenge; geography.
> Ini Lagi

We came across Figma a few weeks before engaging in our first project. It’s worth noting that, I’ve been using Sketch for several years before Narative, and getting out of your comfort zone can be scary.

- Easy migration
- Zero file management
- Figma is platform-agnostic
- Performance

## Easy migration

Not much to say here. You literally just have to copy your art-boards — or as they call it, frames — then paste them into Figma. Simple as that. The platform is very forgiving and prepared for transitions.

## Zero file management

What does that mean? Sketch, Framer, Adobe XD or even Photoshop are native apps where you inherently need to save your work. Some tools have auto-save, of course, but you still end up with hundreds of megabytes and even gigabytes on your drive. And yes, if you lose your disk, break your computer somehow, or have your dog eat your SSD, you will lose your files completely.

Not with Figma. Not having to command+s is a big deal. Figma is a web-based software, meaning you never need to upload, download, or worry about versions again. Imagine a Google Docs for design, keeping all my projects organized in one app, in the cloud. One single source of truth for design files.

I probably saved more than 30GB of disk space by migrating my projects to Figma, and now I can access them from anywhere.

## Figma is platform-agnostic

One of the best features of a web-based software is the fact you’re no longer stuck with an operating system. You can run it right from the browser or from their native app, that’s essentially a wrapper. I’m able to seamlessly start a project on my iMac Pro at my home office, and continue on my Surface Book 2 on the go. That’s huge.

## Performance

You may be thinking that running a full-fledged design app from the web has huge performance drawbacks. I thought the same, but was I ever wrong.

I’ve always had full-spec computers running Sketch, still, ever so often I’d run into performance hiccups or memory drainage. That’s never happened with Figma, which is pretty magical.

### Sample Code

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from "gatsby";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

import * as SocialIcons from "../../icons/social";
import mediaqueries from "@styles/media";

const icons = {
  dribbble: SocialIcons.DribbbleIcon,
  linkedin: SocialIcons.LinkedinIcon,
  twitter: SocialIcons.TwitterIcon,
  facebook: SocialIcons.FacebookIcon,
  instagram: SocialIcons.InstagramIcon,
  github: SocialIcons.GithubIcon
};

const socialQuery = graphql`
  {
    allSite {
      edges {
        node {
          siteMetadata {
            social {
              name
              url
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

function SocialLinks({ fill = "#73737D" }: { fill: string }) {
  const result = useStaticQuery(socialQuery);
  const socialOptions = result.allSite.edges[0].node.siteMetadata.social;

  return (
    <>
      {socialOptions.map(option => {
        const Icon = icons[option.name];

        return (
          <SocialIconContainer
            key={option.name}
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            data-a11y="false"
            aria-label={`Link to ${option.name}`}
            href={option.url}
          >
            <Icon fill={fill} />
          </SocialIconContainer>
        );
      })}
    </>
  );
}
```
