## What is List Virtualization ?

There may be times where we need to display a large list or large table that contains many columns or many rows – _sometimes, even both._ Loading every single item on such a list **can affect performance** significantly. Enter virtualized list —or also know as _“windowing”_, which was a concept of only rendering what is visible to users. This concepts solve the performance problems of rendering large list or table.

## How does List Virtualization Works ?

_"Virtualizing"_ a list of items involves **maintaining a window** and **moving that window around your list**. The number of elements that are rendered at first is a very small subset of the entire list and the _"window"_ of visible content moves when the user continues to scroll. Let’s put it this way: Imagine you have 1000 list of elements, rather than rendering 1000 of elements — _which can affects performance, because on slower initial rendering or scroll performance._ Instead, You only render 5 elements that visible to the user. By implementing virtualized list, it would benefit the low-end devices. You can display more items as the user scrolls, replacing the previous list element with the new one.

## How to implement List Virtualization ?

There’s several library out there that provides this function. But my top two is by Brian Vaughn, `react-virtualized` and `react-window`. Personally, I would prefer `react-window` over the other just because it’s much smaller and faster. Here’s the comparison:

The API’s for both package are relatively similar, but in this case I will use `react-window`.

## List Virtualization Implementation

Lists render a **windowed list (row) of elements** meaning that only the visible rows are displayed to users (e.g **[FixedSizeList](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/list/fixed-size)**, **[VariableSizeList](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/list/variable-size)**). Lists use a Grid (internally) to render rows, relaying props to that inner Grid.

## Grid Virtualization Implementation

Grid renders **tabular data** with virtualization along the X-Axis and Y-Axis — _this means it has both vertical and horizontal virtualization support._ (e.g **[FixedSizeGrid](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/grid/fixed-size)** and **[VariableSizeGrid](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/grid/variable-size)**). It only renders the Grid cells needed to fill itself based on current horizontal/vertical scroll positions.
